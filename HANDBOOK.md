# SECTION 2 — LAND & SYSTEM OVERVIEW

## Goal

Physical layout for 2500-3000 m². Where things go, not how to garden.

## 2.1 Zones

### Tree Zone (North perimeter)
- **Area:** ~800 m²
- **Purpose:** Windbreak, shade, fruit/nuts
- **Layout:** Rows along north edge, 5-8 m spacing
- **Trees:** 12 trees (fruit, nut, support)
- **Understory:** Shade-tolerant perennials

`[DIAGRAM: tree zone layout with spacing]`

### Shrub Zone (Mid-perimeter)
- **Area:** ~600 m²
- **Purpose:** Berry production, nitrogen fixing
- **Layout:** Rows between trees and annuals, 2-3 m spacing
- **Shrubs:** 12 berry + 4 support shrubs
- **Spacing:** 1.5-2 m between bushes

`[DIAGRAM: shrub zone with companion understory]`

### Annual Beds (Central area)
- **Area:** ~1500-1600 m²
- **Purpose:** Main food production
- **Layout:** Raised beds, 1.2 m wide, 0.5 m paths
- **Beds:** ~50 beds of varying lengths
- **Orientation:** North-south for maximum sun

`[DIAGRAM: annual bed layout with paths]`

### Perennial Vegetable Area
- **Area:** ~200 m²
- **Purpose:** Asparagus, rhubarb, artichoke
- **Location:** Separate permanent beds, east side
- **Layout:** 1 m wide beds, permanent placement

## 2.2 Light & Shade Logic

### Full Sun Areas (6+ hours)
- Annual beds (central)
- Most shrubs (mid-perimeter)
- South-facing tree rows

### Partial Shade Areas (4-6 hours)
- Understory of trees
- East/west edges
- Between tree rows

### Shade Areas (<4 hours)
- North side of structures
- Dense tree understory
- Use for: shade-tolerant herbs, some perennials

### Shade Management
- Plant tall crops (corn, sunflowers) on north side of beds
- Use trellises for vertical growing
- Prune trees to allow filtered light
- Rotate shade patterns seasonally

`[DIAGRAM: sun path and shade patterns throughout day]`

## 2.3 Wind & Frost Protection

### Wind Protection
- **North windbreak:** Tree zone (primary)
- **Secondary:** Shrub zone
- **Living fences:** Dense shrubs every 10 m
- **Height:** Trees 8-12 m, shrubs 2-3 m

### Frost Protection
- **Low spots:** Avoid planting frost-sensitive crops
- **Microclimates:** Use structures, trees for protection
- **Row covers:** Temporary protection for early/late season
- **Mulch:** Insulate root zones

### Cold Air Drainage
- **Slope:** Plant cold-sensitive crops on higher ground
- **Barriers:** Don't block cold air flow with solid fences
- **Water features:** Position to moderate temperature

`[DIAGRAM: wind patterns and frost zones]`

## 2.4 Paths and Access

### Main Paths
- **Width:** 1.5 m
- **Material:** Compacted earth, wood chips, or gravel
- **Location:** Between major zones
- **Purpose:** Wheelbarrow access, main routes

### Secondary Paths
- **Width:** 0.5 m
- **Material:** Wood chips or straw
- **Location:** Between annual beds
- **Purpose:** Walking access, minimal compaction

### Access Points
- **Entrance:** South or east side (sun exposure)
- **Tool storage:** Central location
- **Compost area:** Accessible from all zones
- **Water source:** Central or multiple points

### Path Maintenance
- Clear paths monthly
- Add mulch annually
- Avoid walking on beds when wet
- Rotate heavy traffic areas

`[DIAGRAM: full land layout with all zones, paths, and access points]`

## 2.5 Water Access

### Water Sources
- **Primary:** Well or municipal (if available)
- **Secondary:** Rainwater collection
- **Emergency:** Surface water (if accessible)

### Distribution
- **Main lines:** Along main paths
- **Spigots:** Every 20-30 m
- **Hose length:** Maximum 15 m from spigot
- **Irrigation:** Manual or simple drip system

### Rainwater Collection
- **Roof area:** Calculate collection potential
- **Storage:** 5000-10000 L capacity
- **Location:** Elevated for gravity feed
- **Distribution:** Gravity-fed to key areas

`[DIAGRAM: water distribution system]`

## 2.6 Soil Zones

### High Fertility Areas
- Annual beds (amended annually)
- Perennial vegetable area (deeply amended)
- Compost application zones

### Medium Fertility Areas
- Shrub zones (mulched, occasional amendments)
- Tree understory (leaf litter, minimal amendments)

### Low Maintenance Areas
- Tree zones (self-mulching, nitrogen fixers)
- Path edges (living mulches)

### Soil Testing

# SECTION 13 — PLANTING GRID & SPATIAL PLANNING

## Goal

Prevent incompatible plant placements. Find valid spots for new plantings without creating bad neighbor conflicts.

## 13.1 Grid System Overview

### Grid Specifications

- **Dimensions:** 100 columns × 30 rows = 3000 cells
- **Cell size:** Each cell = 1 m²
- **Total area:** 3000 m² (matches handbook's 2500-3000 m² range)
- **Adjacency:** 8-directional (orthogonal + diagonal neighbors)
- **Format:** Numbers represent plants (see plant numbering reference)

### Why Use the Grid

- **Prevent conflicts:** Avoid placing incompatible plants adjacent
- **Quick planning:** Find valid spots for new plantings mid-season
- **Visual layout:** See entire garden space at once
- **Succession planning:** Plan multi-season plantings in same cells

## 13.2 Plant Numbering System

Each plant has been assigned a number. Use these numbers in grid cells.

**Key plants:**
- 1. Tomato
- 2. Pepper
- 3. Bean
- 4. Pea
- 5. Cabbage
- 6. Carrot
- 7. Onion
- 8. Potato
- 9. Corn
- 10. Squash
- 11. Cucumber
- 12. Lettuce
- 13. Radish
- 14. Spinach
- 15. Kale
- 16. Beet
- 17. Garlic
- 18. Basil
- 19. Marigold
- 20. Nasturtium

**See `plant_numbers.md` for complete list of all 104 plants.**

## 13.3 Multi-Season Notation

Use semicolon to indicate succession planting in same cell:

- `1;5` = Plant 1 (Tomato) in first season, then Plant 5 (Cabbage) in second season
- `21;29` = Plant 21 (Lentil) in spring, then Plant 29 (Wheat) in fall
- `4;12` = Plant 4 (Pea) in spring, then Plant 12 (Lettuce) in fall

**Order matters:** First number = first season, second number = second season.

## 13.4 Adjacency Rules

### 8-Directional Adjacency

Each cell checks 8 neighboring cells:
- Up, Down, Left, Right (orthogonal)
- Top-left, Top-right, Bottom-left, Bottom-right (diagonal)

### Validation Logic

**Cannot place plant if:**
- Any adjacent cell contains an incompatible plant (see companion rules)

**Can place plant if:**
- Cell is empty
- All adjacent cells are empty OR contain compatible plants

**Example:**
- Cell has Tomato (1) → Cannot place Potato (8) in adjacent cells
- Cell has Bean (3) → Cannot place Onion (7) or Garlic (17) in adjacent cells
- Cell has Carrot (6) → Cannot place Dill (64) or Fennel (66) in adjacent cells

## 13.5 Space Requirements

### Calculating Cells Needed

**From Section 1 (Seed amounts) and Section 5 (Yields):**

1. **Determine total m² needed:**
   - Seed amount per year (Section 1)
   - Expected yield per m² (Section 5)
   - Calculate: Total m² = (Annual need / Yield per m²)

2. **Account for spacing:**
   - Row spacing × plant spacing = area per plant
   - Plants per m² = 1 m² / area per plant
   - Adjust for actual planting density

3. **Plant type considerations:**
   - **Trees:** 4-16 m² (2×2 to 4×4 cells) - leave buffer cells
   - **Shrubs:** 1-4 m² (1×1 to 2×2 cells)
   - **Large vegetables:** 0.5-1 m² per plant
   - **Small vegetables/herbs:** Multiple plants per m²

### Example Calculations

**Potato:**
- Seed: 15 kg seed potatoes
- Spacing: 30 cm × 75 cm = 0.225 m² per plant
- Yield: 3-5 kg per m²
- Need: ~100-150 m² (100-150 cells)

**Tomato:**
- Seed: 5 g
- Spacing: 60-90 cm × 90 cm = ~0.5-0.8 m² per plant
- Yield: 5-10 kg per m²
- Need: ~20-40 m² (20-40 cells)

**Wheat:**
- Seed: 2.5 kg
- Spacing: Broadcast or rows 15-20 cm apart
- Yield: 500-800 g per m²
- Need: ~300-500 m² (300-500 cells)

## 13.6 Using the Grid

### Interactive Tool (grid.html)

1. **Open `grid.html` in web browser**
2. **Select plant** from dropdown
3. **Choose mode:**
   - **Place Plant:** Click cell to place selected plant
   - **Check Valid Spots:** Highlights all valid placement locations
   - **Remove Plant:** Click cell to remove plant
4. **Visual feedback:**
   - Green = Valid placement
   - Red = Invalid (conflict with adjacent)
   - Blue = Has plant
   - Gray = Empty

### CSV Template (grid_template.csv)

1. **Open `grid_template.csv` in spreadsheet**
2. **Enter plant numbers** in cells
3. **Use semicolon** for multi-season (e.g., "1;5")
4. **Leave empty** for paths, buffers, unused space
5. **Validate manually** using companion rules

### Validation Checklist

Before placing a plant, check:
- [ ] Cell is empty (or planning succession)
- [ ] No incompatible plants in 8 adjacent cells
- [ ] Enough space for plant's requirements
- [ ] Compatible with plants in adjacent cells

## 13.7 Common Incompatible Pairs

**Critical conflicts to avoid:**
- Tomato ↔ Potato, Fennel, Corn
- Bean/Pea ↔ Onion, Garlic
- Potato ↔ Tomato, Squash, Cucumber
- Carrot ↔ Dill, Fennel
- Cabbage ↔ Tomato, Strawberry
- Corn ↔ Tomato
- Squash ↔ Potato
- Cucumber ↔ Potato

**See Section 4.6 Companion Planting Matrix for complete list.**

## 13.8 Grid Layout Tips

### Zoning

- **North edge:** Trees (permanent, large cells)
- **Mid-perimeter:** Shrubs (permanent, medium cells)
- **Central area:** Annuals (rotating, flexible)

### Paths and Buffers

- Leave empty cells for paths (0.5-1 m wide = 1-2 cells)
- Leave buffer cells between incompatible zones
- Use empty cells to separate conflicting plant groups

### Succession Planning

- Plan spring → fall successions in same cells
- Use semicolon notation: `4;12` (Pea then Lettuce)
- Check both seasons for compatibility

### Example Layout Pattern

```
Row 1:  [Tree] [Empty] [Tree] [Empty] [Tree] ...
Row 2:  [Empty] [Shrub] [Empty] [Shrub] [Empty] ...
Row 3:  [1] [18] [1] [18] [1] ... (Tomato, Basil)
Row 4:  [6] [7] [6] [7] [6] ... (Carrot, Onion)
```

- **plant_numbers.md** - Full plant numbering reference

## 13.10 Quick Reference

**To find valid spot for new plant:**
1. Open grid.html
2. Select plant number
3. Choose "Check Valid Spots" mode
4. Green cells = safe to plant
5. Red cells = conflicts with adjacent plants

**To plan succession:**
1. Identify empty cells after harvest
2. Check what was planted there (if any)
3. Select new plant for next season
4. Use semicolon notation: `old;new`
5. Validate both plants are compatible with neighbors

**To avoid conflicts:**
- Always check 8 adjacent cells before placing
- Refer to companion_rules.json for incompatibilities
- Leave buffer cells between incompatible zones
- Use empty cells strategically
